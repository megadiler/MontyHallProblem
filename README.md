# MontyHallProblem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem U're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do U want to pick door 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
